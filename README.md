A lightweight implementation of the Social Force Model for Social Local Navigation. 
It is based on the model proposed by Helbing and Molnar [1] and extended for social groups by Moussaid et Al. [2]:

- **[1]** Helbing, Dirk & Molnar, Peter. (1998). *Social Force Model for Pedestrian Dynamics*. Physical Review E. 51. 10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282. 
- **[2]** Moussa√Ød, Mehdi & Perozo, Niriaska & Garnier, Simon & Helbing, Dirk & Theraulaz, Guy. (2010). *The Walking Behaviour of Pedestrian Social Groups and Its Impact on Crowd Dynamics*. PloS one. 5. e10047. 10.1371/journal.pone.0010047. 

The model consists on the definition of different attractive and repulsive forces that describe the local navigation behavior of pedestrians. 

*F<sub>total</sub> = f<sub>goal</sub> + f<sub>obs</sub> + f<sub>ped</sub> + f<sub>group</sub>*

## FORCES
### 1. Attractive force to reach the goal (f<sub>goal</sub>)


### 2. Repulsive force of obstacle (f<sub>obs</sub>)


### 3. Respulsive force of other pedestrians (f<sub>ped</sub>)


### 4. Force of interaction groups (f<sub>group</sub>)
